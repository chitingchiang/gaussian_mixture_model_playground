# Gaussian mixture model playground

This is a playground of Gaussian mixture model to explore its performance.

In [naive_gmm.ipynb](naive_gmm.ipynb), we attempt a naive implementation of expectation-maximization algorithm for the Gaussian mixture model. The implementation is not complete or entirely correct - we fix the prior and do not infer it from the data.

In [complete_gmm.ipynb](complete_gmm.ipynb), we implement the complete expectation-maximization algorithm to train the Gaussian mixture model.
