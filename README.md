# Gaussian mixture model playground

This is a playground of Gaussian mixture model to explore its performance.

We attempt a naive implementation of expectation maximization algorithm. The implementation is not complete or entirely correct - we fix the prior and do not infer it from the data. We start by a [uniform prior](uniform_prior.ipynb) for two Gaussian distributions and then a [non-uniform prior](nonuniform_prior.ipynb).
